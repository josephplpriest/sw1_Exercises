# Pet Store
This program is an exercise in C# fundamentals. 
Currently, the program allows one to add products to an inventory, and there is an option to retrieve select inputted information in JSON format. 

The program is currently very limited in what it can do, but there are many possibilities for development (e.g., storing inputted information in a SQLite database, counting overall inventory, etc.).
